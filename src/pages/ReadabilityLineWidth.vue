              <p class="body-1 body__text">Let's picture trivia night, an escape room or a scavenger hunt with only one person competing. The other competitors are multimember teams with diverse backgrounds, tastes and experiences. The multimember team has many advantages over the individual, and the same is true for user experience. When it comes to software development and design, you need to rely on the entire team for multiple viewpoints and opinions to create a more beautiful and functional design.</p>
              <p class="body-1 body__text">While the entire team is responsible for UX, software development and design have the largest impact and greatest accountability. The two must work together toward a common goal. However, that requires the ability to speak a common language. Developers speak in terms of coding practices, languages and libraries, while designers speak in terms of research, styling and deliverables. When both take into account the larger mission to address the user's needs, they can overcome some of these differences in language. To bridge the language gap, each needs to learn the essentials about the other's role. With a basic understanding, a common language between software development and design can be created. Frequent communication between them will ensure that designs are not only able to be implemented but have also taken into account multiple angles and viewpoints.</p>
